# curvelet-AFBF

This repository contains MATLAB code for implementing the methodology described in our paper for synthesizing Anisotropic Fractional Brownian Fields (AFBF) using Curvelet transforms. The purpose of these codes is to provide researchers and practitioners with a practical tool to generate AFBF and to facilitate the reproducibility of our results.
